    <h2>Nurturing Values...</h2>
    <p>Education has been undergoing a sea of change over the decades. In the past it was considered as a tool for getting a job.
       Today, it is not just a mean for achieving a suitable job. Every parent wants his/her child to grow into a perfect gentleman
      from a shy or a noisy child after completing education. It is an undisputable fact that education gets high status in the society
         irrespective of their financial position. The corollary is also true. However financially sound you are, you will never get due
          recognition if you don't have proper education.</p>
    <p>Education is a sort of oxygen for prestigious social living. So the school started its mission almost 40 years back. Now people behind the mission can proudly wear the recognition from CBSE, New Delhi as a proof of faultless effort and unbridled dedication they have put up. Having completely constructed the infrastructure for secondary education, the school is now all set to venture into senior secondary education. Efforts are going on at full stretch to start plus one and plus two classes within next two years. This will be a relief for parents after high school.</p>
